# Inventory-Management
An application inspired by Libra for personal inventory management
This application will be built by someone with very little coding knowledge leaning heavily on Ai 

The goal of this application is to allow the user to Inventory and easily record Metadata and photos of each item. Allow the use to easily generate qr codes for groups of items located in bins and to allow the upload of warranty information in the form of photos and URLs. This application will help with house fires via claims reporting since all the data of the items you own is centralized and will be easy to share. Id hope to also capture Pricing of items to later be compared to current market rates to empower the user to make smart choices with their selling of goods.

Future goals would be to create a social area infused with tools to help thwart scammers for users to buy / Trade & sell their items with a modern UI.
